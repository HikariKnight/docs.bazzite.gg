## GPD Win 4

![gpdwin4|690x328, 100%](../../img/gpdwin4.jpeg)


### General Information & Optional Tweaks

- Adjust RGB with Steam Gaming Mode in Handheld Daemon
- Adjust the scaling of the UI in the Display Settings
- Set a charge limit in HHD with Handheld Daemon
- GPD devices also have a physical switch you can toggle to enable a separate desktop/mouse mode.

### Workarounds / Known Issues

- Suspend-resume fully works on the 6800u Win 4 after disabling the fingerprint scanner, but there are a few user reports of the 7840u and newer models having only partially working suspend-resume.
  - It seems to be very similar/related to the suspend issue on the GPD WM2 7840u and newer devices, more details [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3154)
- Games can sometimes default to 800p resolution.
  - Manually change the resolution per game in the `Steam Settings > Properties > Game Resolution` to either `Native` or other higher resolutions.
- Back buttons may need to be manually remapped before they are usable.
  - Manually remap back buttons as described in hhd docs [here](https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd?tab=readme-ov-file#extra-steps-gpd-win-devices)
